SLIDE 3: INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
-------------------------
In the digital age, spam and phishing attacks have become increasingly
sophisticated, posing significant threats to individuals and organizations.
Cambodia has seen a rise in SMS scams, fraudulent messages, and phishing
attempts targeting mobile users. Traditional rule-based spam filters are no
longer sufficient to combat these evolving threats, creating a need for
intelligent, AI-powered detection systems.


PROBLEM STATEMENTS
------------------
- Increasing volume of spam messages and phishing attacks targeting mobile users
- Traditional spam filters fail to detect sophisticated social engineering attacks
- Lack of accessible, user-friendly tools for Cambodian users to verify suspicious messages
- Voice-based scams are emerging but few solutions address voice message analysis
- Users often fall victim to brand impersonation and URL-based phishing attacks


AIM AND OBJECTIVES
------------------
Aim: To develop an AI-powered mobile application that detects spam, phishing,
and social engineering threats in text and voice messages with high accuracy.

Objectives:
- Provide real-time spam detection with 95%+ accuracy
- Detect phishing attempts including URL analysis and brand impersonation
- Support both text and voice message scanning
- Offer user-friendly mobile interface for easy threat verification
- Maintain scan history for user awareness and learning


LIMITATION AND SCOPES
---------------------
Limitations:
- Platform: Mobile application (iOS and Android via Flutter)
- Target: Individual users (not enterprise-level deployment)
- Language: Primarily English text analysis

Scopes (Features):
- Text message spam detection
- Voice message transcription and analysis
- Phishing URL detection
- Brand impersonation detection
- Scan history management
- User threat reporting system
- Statistics dashboard

================================================================================
SLIDE 7: DISCUSSION
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. Ensemble approach outperforms single models
   - Combining Random Forest and XGBoost achieves higher accuracy than
     individual classifiers, consistent with findings by Gupta et al. (2021).

2. TF-IDF remains effective for SMS spam
   - Despite advances in deep learning, TF-IDF with traditional ML achieves
     comparable results to transformer models for short text classification,
     similar to Almeida et al. (2011).

3. URL feature extraction is critical for phishing
   - Our 30+ feature extraction approach aligns with Mohammad et al. (2014),
     achieving 92.5% phishing detection rate.

4. Hybrid rule-based + ML improves explainability
   - Unlike pure deep learning approaches, our hybrid method provides
     interpretable threat indicators to users.

5. Voice transcription adds value
   - Extending spam detection to voice messages addresses a gap in existing
     research, as most studies focus only on text.
