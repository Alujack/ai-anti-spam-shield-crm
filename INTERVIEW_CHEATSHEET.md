## YOUR PROJECT IN 30 SECONDS

> "I built **AI Anti-Spam Shield** - a microservices system that detects spam, phishing, and scam threats. It has a **Node.js backend**, **Python ML service**, and **Flutter mobile app**. It achieves **96% accuracy** with **<100ms** response time."

## TECH STACK - QUICK REFERENCE

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express | REST API, WebSocket |
| **ML Service** | Python + FastAPI | AI inference (BERT) |
| **Mobile** | Flutter + Dart | Cross-platform app |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + Prisma | Data storage |
| **Cache/Queue** | Redis + BullMQ | Caching, job queue |
| **Gateway** | Kong | Rate limiting, routing |
| **Containers** | Docker + Compose | Deployment |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana | Metrics |

---

## KEY NUMBERS TO MENTION

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Spam Accuracy | **96.2%** |
| API Response | **<100ms** |
| Voice Processing | **<2 seconds** |
| Architecture | **10 services** |

## SDLC - YOUR WORKFLOW

```
Requirements → Planning → Design → Coding → Testing → CI/CD → Deploy → Monitor
```

**One-liner:**
> "Requirements first, plan in phases, design architecture, clean code with Git workflow, test at all levels, automate with CI/CD, containerize with Docker, monitor with Prometheus."

## TOP 5 QUESTIONS THEY'LL ASK

### 1. "Tell me about yourself"
> "I'm a Full Stack Developer with experience in Node.js, Python, and Flutter. I built an AI Anti-Spam Shield that detects threats with 96% accuracy using microservices architecture."

### 2. "Why this company?"
> "Peng Huoth is a leading property developer. I'm excited to build ERP systems that impact real business operations. The tech stack aligns with my skills."

### 3. "Your biggest challenge?"
> "Integrating ML with the backend. I solved it by using microservices - the ML service runs independently and communicates via REST API. This allows independent scaling."

### 4. "How do you handle deadlines?"
> "I break tasks into phases, prioritize MVP features, and communicate early if there are blockers. Documentation as I go, not at the end."

### 5. "What if you don't know something?"
> "I'm honest about gaps and quick to learn. I taught myself Flutter and FastAPI for this project. Core concepts transfer across technologies."
